I had many interests as a twenty-something. These ranged from sports, film, and robotics to social justice and politics. Although I was planning to go to law school as a psych and political science double major (probably to do human rights law), I took a course in social and personality psychology and was hooked. I was hooked by the idea that one could study questions on topics such as attitude change, stereotyping and prejudice, and impression formation. And I was especially excited to learn about an entire interdisciplinary subfield, political psychology, that combined my growing interests in political science and psychology. Research was the thing for me.\\nAfter graduating from John Carroll, I honed my research skills as a research coordinator at Duke University’s Interdisciplinary Initiative in Social Psychology, working under Professors Wendy Wood and Mark Leary. I then went on to earn my PhD in Social and Personality Psychology from Washington University with Alan Lambert, studying social and personality psychology. Since then, I completed two postdoctoral positions at Emory and Carnegie Mellon, before arriving at Seattle University.\\nTeaching & Research Interests\\nI will be teaching several required courses in the major such as Introduction to Social Psychology, Statistics and Research Methods, and Organizational Psychology. In the future, I hope to teach courses in political psychology and emotions and decision making. My research focuses on the consequences of threat, justice seeking, and emotion within social and organizational psychology.\\nRecent Publications\\n1. Zhao†, M., Eadeh†, F. R. Nguyen, T.

I also have interests in Metaphysics (broadly construed) Critical Social Theory, and the History of Philosophy. My current lies at the intersection of metaphysics and history where I explore and try to answer some of the following questions. How is it that history ‘happens,’ so to speak? Does it unfold in a narrative manner? Or is history marked by points of legitimate ontological disruption, such that we can talk about entirely new ways of being coming into existence? What kind of metaphysics must we articulate to account for ruptures or breaks in historical continuity such as social revolutions or violent fractures in nature such as ecological crises? I teach courses in the core curriculum where my aim is to work with students to show how a rigorous study of philosophy can have a meaningful impact in their lives by better helping them understand themselves, the communities in which we live, and the problems we face as a society.\\nNext steps\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jarryn-robinson.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jarylin-reese-dnp-arnp-fnp-c-rn-bs.php': 'Profile Type:\\nContact Information\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jaskern-kaur.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jasmine-pickens-psyd-amft.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-bond.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-farrell.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-hall.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-howell.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-seid.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jason-wirth-phd.php': 'Associate Appointment, Film Studies\\nCompare\\nCompare\\nPublications\\nHis recent books include Nietzsche and Other Buddhas: Philosophy after Comparative Philosophy (Indiana 2019), Mountains, Rivers, and the Great Earth: Reading Gary Snyder and Dōgen in an Age of Ecological Crisis (SUNY 2017), a monograph on Milan Kundera (Commiserating with Devastated Things, Fordham 2015), Schelling’s Practice of the Wild (SUNY 2015), and the co-edited volume (with Bret Davis and Brian Schroeder), Japanese and Continental Philosophy: Conversations with the Kyoto School (Indiana 2011).\\nNext steps\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/javier-ortiz.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jay-heitman.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jayme-jacobson.php': \"Compare\\nBiography\\nJayme has been working in the field of instructional design since 2001 when she took a position at Washington State University’s Center for Teaching, Learning, & Technology.

Kasumi is currently both a Professor of Design and Director of the Design Program. She started teaching at Seattle University in 2003 and established the Digital Design Program. The program is named the Design Program and is situated in the Department of Visual Arts.\\nKasumi\\'s work spans various media, both ephemeral and permanent, with recurring themes of “presence and absence,” “memory/memorial,” and “loss and healing,” rooted in her personal experiences of loss and grief—central to her installation art and research. Her primary focus is a memorial series that employs a ritualistic process of repetitive, spontaneous creation of handmade objects. The sheer volume of these small objects underscores the scale, concept, and tangible quality of the work, serving as a therapeutic and redemptive process reflecting personal struggle. Her smaller-scale projects include book art, video, and design.\\nAn internationally active installation artist, Kasumi\\'s solo and group exhibitions span galleries and educational institutions worldwide. In Seattle, her work has been featured at venues such as the Wing Luke Asian Museum, Seattle Art Museum, Olympic Sculpture Park, the Gardner Center for Asian Arts & Ideas, Seattle Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle University, with some pieces housed in University of Washington’s and Seattle University’s Special Collections.\\nHer work has also been exhibited in cities across the U.S., including Rochester, Philadelphia, Chicago, Gainesville, Denver, and Anchorage, as well as in Portland and Eugene, Oregon. Internationally, she has exhibited in Verona, Frankfurt, Budapest, Brisbane, Sydney, Hobert (Tasmania), New Delhi, Shanghai, and Belize. In Japan, her exhibitions span Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukushima, Kamaishi, and many other cities.\\nKasumi has been invited as an artist-in-residence at the Soji-ji Temple in Yokohama, Japan, where she presented her signature piece \"Sarit\" (Flow of Compassion) for the 650th anniversary of the temple’s second Zen Master. In 2019, she created a large installation for the permanent collection at the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, focusing on ecological concerns and water pollution. In 2020, she was invited to exhibit in “Make Crises Visible,” an activism art and design collection, at the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in Frankfurt, Germany.\\nCompare\\nEducation\\nBA in Social Welfare at Bukkyo University, in Kyoto, Japan\\nCompare\\nCourses Taught\\nKasumi teaches the majority of the program’s graphic design courses, including Typography, the Graphic Design 1 and 2 sequence, Artist\\'s Book, and Senior Synthesis. Through her unique approach to inclusive design studio pedagogy and creative design thinking, she emphasizes the education of the whole person. In her courses, students not only acquire the technical skills necessary for design professionals but also apply these skills through community-engaged service-learning projects. These projects are designed to promote, support, educate, and raise awareness within the community. Additionally, students have the opportunity to collaborate with teams external to academia, which allows them to build their professional portfolios in real-world contexts.\\nAt Seattle University, Professor Kasumi created and currently directs the Japan Program, a summer study-abroad Studio Art experience in Yokohama, Japan. Previously, she also created and directed the Siena Program, which was offered in Siena, Italy, for ten years. In both programs, students engage deeply with the art of bookmaking, facilitated by collaborations between Kasumi, local scholars, and hand-print artisans.\\nIn addition to her academic work, Kasumi is deeply committed to community service. She has traveled with Professionals Without Borders to assist with projects at the Chikuni Mission in Zambia and has led a team of students in creating a large-scale installation art project at an orphanage in Ladyville, Belize.\\nNext steps\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/naomi-g-rosenberg.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/natalia-garcia.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/natalia-gunawan.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/natalie-welch-phd.php': 'Enrolled member of Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and raised on the Cherokee Indian Reservation in Cherokee, NC.

Molecular chaperones (also referred to as heat shock proteins) are cellular components that play essential roles in facilitating intracellular signaling and in assisting the patient respond to environmental stress. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic variability within a population, which gives rise to differences in drug response from patient to patient.Understanding -- and ultimately accounting for -- interpatient variability in response to drug therapy is a crucial mechanism for improving patient care. In conjunction with ongoing clinical trials at the Hope Heart Institute, we are beginning to establish the extent to which molecular chaperone expression provides a prognostic value for patients being treated for cardiovascular disease.\\nVisiting Scientist, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\\nIn collaboration with faculty in the Human Biology and Basic Sciences Divisions of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, we are utilizing a novel screening assay to delineate drug sensitivity of laboratory-derived and naturally occurring strains of yeast.

Since the days when I was shocked out of my complacency during a dig at Tel Laish (now Tel Dan) when I witnessed terrible things happening to the indigenous Palestinians just south of us, I couldn’t keep my focus on the ancient and medieval church. For the past two decades, I have focused my work in two areas: justice (and understandings of justice) for competing parties in the Middle East and, more recently, questions of sexual and gender justice within the church. Both interests have begun to coalesce at the theoretical level as my interdisciplinary study of the issues continue to point to common roots of problems I once considered unrelated. I am currently constructing the theoretical framework that links them and many other questions of injustice in our age.\\nMy work on justice in the Middle East has not been merely academic. Back in 2005, I brought together a loose coalition of partners from the Christian Peacemaker Teams, Operation Dove, Rabbis for Human Rights in Palestine, Birzeit University and Bethlehem University to conduct workshops on the principles of nonviolence, nonviolent resistance, and community organization. Initially, we tried to conduct our workshops in the north as well as the south, but we quickly found that we were spread too thin, so we focused our energies in the south in Hebron and its environs – towns like Rafah and Yatta and villages on the southern border of the West Bank like At-Tuwani, Qhor-Tuba, and Um-Faqara, where the violence against the Palestinians outside Gaza has been most severe. That work has temporarily hijacked my efforts to maintain an active writing regimen. In many ways, it has shattered me. But nothing has felt more important to me than helping the salt of the earth find ways to survive their circumstances.\\nNext steps\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/philip-orlow.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/phillip-thompson-phd-pe.php': 'Civil Environmental Engineering | E-waste | Hydrology | Sustainability\\nExamines alternative water treatment systems for developing countries.

She has a PhD in Creative Writing from the University of Denver and is a MacDowell Fellow, a Kundiman Fellow, a RedLine Artist In-Residence and a Fulbright Scholar (Bangalore, India). Her third book, Dayawati, Of Mercy, is forthcoming from Graywolf Press in 2026. She has two films, Dogana/Chapti (2019, Official Selection at Frameline43 and Seattle Queer Film Festival) and Mother Ghosting(2018). She was a featured artist in Harper's Bazaar (India), Revry, as well as in the Denver Westword’s “100 Colorado Creatives.” She has recent publications with The Academy of American Poets, Burrow Press Review, Sink, Foglifter, and the anthology Alone Together: Love , Grief and Comfort in the Time of COVID-19 (Washington State Book Award, 2021). She also has critical essays in Matters of Feminist Practice (Belladonna Collective, 2019), Rehearsing Racial Equity: A Critical Anthology on Anti-Racism and Repair in the Arts (Amherst College Press, forthcoming 2024) and in the republication of Judy Grahn’s The Highest Apple: Sappho and the Lesbian Poetic Tradition (Sinister Wisdom, Fall 2023). In October 2020, Serena co-directed No Place to Go, an artist-made queer haunted house with Kate Speer and Frankie Toan.\\nDr. Chopra's third book Dayawati, Of Mercy is an interdisciplinary (film and text) poetic memoir about familial lineages of domestic violence, the prairie and resilience. Her current research interests include trauma writing, queer forms and expressions as capital-colonial resistance, rhizomes, the problematics of neoliberal healing narratives, and tracing historiographies of poetic thought. As a poet and interdisciplinary artist, Dr. Chopra's teaching interests approach creative composition through interdisciplinary and hybrid modalities. Her students explore poetic resonance and poignancy through various mediums and disciplines, such as text, film/moving image, sound, dance/movement, photography, collage and performance art, etc.\\nHer courses align creative composition with intersectional queer and feminist studies, offering students a critical and embodied creative experience that inspires profound student projects, including the production of chapbook-length manuscripts at the upper-division level. The theoretical and historiographical gestures of her courses serve to invite students into significant ongoing conversations related to creativity, identity, positionality and social impact, and engage students with inspired lineages and a contemporary scope for their critical and creative work. Dr. Chopra's classes teach aesthetic, craft and formal principles and tools, but also help students develop trust and confidence in their innate and intuitive embodied practices, allowing them to access the poignant possibilities below the narrative's surface.\\nRather than emphasizing rules towards technical perfection, Dr. Chopra guides students through their own poetic and visionary concerns, concentrating on strengthening creativity, voice and critical perspectives. She encourages students to engage multi-disciplinary experiments and practices, guiding them to encounter their creative visions as dynamic, expressive potential.\\nCompare\\nEducation\\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder, MFA, Creative Writing\\nCompare\\nWriting Grief\\nThe Feminist Epic\\nDr. Chopra is dedicated to the professional development of her students, mentoring them in developing full-length manuscripts (especially as an advisor for creative Department Honors projects), helping students prepare applications for MFA programs, residencies and Fulbright Scholarships, and advising them about publishing their creative and critical work.\\nCompare\\nPublications\\nBooks:\\nSelections from Dayawati, Of Mercy, #304, Belladonna* Chaplet Series, 2023\\nIc, HorseLess Press, 2017\\nThis Human, Coconut Books, 2013\\nCritical and Creative Journel Publications:\\n“A House of Haunted Women,” essay included in the republication of Judy Grahn’s The Highest Apple: Sappho and the Lesbian Poetic Tradition, Sinister Wisdom, 2023\\n“I Wanted to Write a Book that Was Like Laying Down: Proximity to Loss and the Erotics of Antiracist Healing,” Rehearsing Racial Equity, ed.

Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. with heart failure, defined as the inability to adequately pump blood, as the fastest growing subgroup. Heart failure results from a number of diseases including chronic hypertension, myocardial infarction, mutations in sarcomere proteins, and valvular dysfunction. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy, an increase in heart mass characterized by cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, is fundamental to all these disease processes. An increase in heart mass is also associated with a beneficial adaptation following exercise, referred to as physiological cardiac hypertrophy. Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is widely believed to result from activation of signaling pathways that are distinct from pathways activated by pathologic stimuli.Since adult cardiac myocytes have limited proliferative ability, cell cycle regulators have traditionally been thought to play little role in cardiac growth. However, recent research, including his own, has demonstrated that cell cycle regulators (specifically cyclin D2) are in fact involved in cardiac hypertrophy.\\nMy research aims are twofold: 1) to understand the role of cell cycle regulators in both physiologic and pathologic hypertrophy; and 2) to identify regulators that promote beneficial cardiac growth and improved cardiac function in the context of heart disease. Ultimately, findings from this research may contribute to the development of therapies to mitigate the effects of heart failure.\\nBiography\\nProfessor Luckey received his B.A. in Chemistry from the University of Dayton, his Ph.D. in Molecular Toxicology from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, and conducted his postdoctoral research in the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Department at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

She returned to Chicago to study sociology at the University of Chicago and fell in love with the discipline after conducting an ethnographic study of a Hyde Park street.\\nAfter college, she worked for two years in fundraising/development, first for the University of Chicago Library and then for a domestic violence shelter in the city—the only Chicago shelter at that time to welcome women and their children. Deeply committed to advancing women’s health and reproductive justice, she decided to attend graduate school in sociology at UC San Francisco , renowned for medical sociology, women\\'s health, qualitative methodologies, and health policy.\\nAfter earning her Ph.D. in sociology at the University of California, San Francisco in 1995, she began a postdoctoral fellowship in biomedical ethics at Stanford University. As an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz, she published her first book, The Making of the Unborn Patient , in 1998, which won the C. Wright Mills Award . She was tenured at UCSC and then, unconventionally, took a hiatus from academia to pursue another important mission—mothering.\\nIn 2000, on an extended leave of absence from UCSC, she moved to a little yellow bungalow on Whidbey Island in Washington State.

Prior to graduation, I completed my clinical internship at Seattle Counseling Service, a community mental health agency with a specific mission to serve the LGBTQIA++ community.\\nI currently work as a clinician, clinical supervisor, and Director of Couples and Relational Therapy at Pacific Behavioral Healthcare , a private group practice in Bellevue, WA that specializes in providing services for intimate partnerships at the intersection of relational and sexual concerns. I continue to serve the couple and family therapy (CFT) profession in Washington by volunteering with the Washington Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (WAMFT); various roles have included board member at-large, Legislative Committee Chair, and various committee memberships. I am passionate about advocacy for the sustainability of the CFT profession at the policy level and continue to serve on WAMFT’s Legislative Committee.\\nAs a Washington State approved supervisor and AAMFT Approved Supervisor Candidate, my overall goal in supervision is to support you in becoming the best therapist version of you within your preferred therapy approach and theory. My supervision approach tends toward collaborative, relational, and strengths based with particular emphasis on person of the therapist development within your comfort zone. I endeavor to attune to diverse identities and social locations within the client-therapy system and how these impact the way we relate to each other.\\nIn my clinical work, I specialize in working with distressed partnerships and intimate relationships at the intersection of relationships and sexuality, often including interpersonal trauma occurring between intimate partners. I am influenced by Bowen Family Systems Theory, the early experiential family therapists (Whitaker & Satir), Certified Sex Therapist credentialing, Emotionally-Focused Therapy, Gottman’s relationship research, and Internal Family Systems Therapy.\\nMy clinical work integrates attachment theory, differentiation theory, system thinking, and interpersonal neurobiology , and I’ve found Bader and Pearson’ Developmental Model of Couples Therapy to be particularly robust as a clinical resource for this integration. I've also found Juliane Taylor Shore, LMFT 's application of interpersonal neurobiology to relational clinical work to be particularly effective and well-endorsed by clients, and I’ve discovered Dr. Alexandra Solomon ’s work as a fresh, approachable resource for viewing relationships/systems with what Boszormenyi-Nagy calls multidirectional partiality.\\nI view human beings as naturally moving toward wholeness and integration, and I think of life/relationship challenges as not so much a problem to solve but a dialectic to balance. Whitaker’s (1989) words inspire me: “The process of learning how to love and how to become part of a we without destroying yourself is a long-term project. It begins with learning how to love yourself and then learning how to love someone like you, and moves on to the courage to love someone different from you, to learning how to tolerate the vulnerability and struggle over the problem of how to be all you are, which must include a significant other” (p. 98).\\nNext steps\\n\", 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/darci-freeman.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/gayle-clemans.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/hahkyung-kim.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/heather-nielson.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/imani-sims.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jennifer-satterwhite.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/jessica-vu.php': 'BA Psychology-University of Washington, Seattle\\nNext steps\\n', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/lillian-martz.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/lisa-sibbett.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/michelle-byrd.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/tammy-huson.php': '', 'https://www.seattleu.edu/directory/profiles/william-cheung.php': ''}\n"
